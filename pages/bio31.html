      Hi I’m Sigourney, I was found outside running around in the cold but some nice people brought me inside and I’ve
      been loving house rabbit life! I like to throw toys in the air and zoom around. I’m very tidy when I’m out playing
      & I’m getting better with my litterbox everyday. I take a few days to warm up but after that you can give me some
      pets. My foster mom says I look like a cute little stuffed animal. I would love to meet you!
