      Hello! My name is Ruby. I love feeling safe and having room to stretch my legs. I also love food and will prove it
      by dancing for you! <br> <br> I have arthritis and get meloxicam every day which I lap up like it’s candy. Because
      of my arthritis I need special litterbox accommodations, the area immediately surrounding my litterbox can be a
      little messy. The rest of my enclosure is very tidy though! <br> <br> I get along with my foster family and lounge
      next to my rabbit buddy in an enclosure next to mine. Because I wasn’t treated very well prior to rescue I have
      some trust issues and strangers make me a bit anxious. <br> <br> I would rather not be picked up. I need someone
      patient who will cherish me as I am and remind me that I am very special. It won’t be long before I will lay my
      velvety head on your foot and wait for you to pet me.
