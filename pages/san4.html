      Curly was found as a stray in Greenwood, very skinny and with eye infection. She was turned into an Indiana
      shelter, who helped get her weight back up and treated her eyes. But Curly was kind of stuck at the shelter...
      they didn't have a spay/neuter connection, and Curly was getting cranky about being there. IHRS came in to take
      Curly to rescue after care after she'd been at the shelter a couple of months. One thing we discovered while at
      the shelter: Curly had terribly maloccluded incisors! <br> <br> Curly had to learn to eat different kinds of food
      post her dental surgeries. She has trouble with grooming because she does not have teeth to help with that task.
      Her foster home helps her with this and Curly is good with cleaning as best she can with her tongue! The extent of
      her issues is so severe, her veterinarian feels she should remain in sanctuary status.<br> <br> Curly is an
      incredibly happy bunny, especially because she is bonded to her best friend
      Violet, another special needs bunny! Violet and Curly snuggle a lot. We do have to separate them at mealtimes
      since Curly is very slow to chew her soft pellets and Violet tries to steal them all, but otherwise they spend all
      their time together. We are so happy they have found each other for comfort and friendship even though they both
      have serious health needs.
