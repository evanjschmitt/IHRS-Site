    <h1>Indiana Rabbit Veterinarians</h1>
    <p>Choosing a veterinarian is a big decision. The house rabbit or other exotic animal caregiver has added difficulty
        because not all veterinarians are knowledgeable in the specifics of treating exotics. <br> <br>

        Exotic animal and wildlife veterinary medicine is quite different from that for dogs and cats, and a well
        meaning but inexperienced veterinarian may not be able to provide the best care for your rabbit. <br> <br>

        The following list is being provided to help ease your search. These Indiana veterinarians have either been
        recommended by house rabbit caregivers or have been prescreened from the yellow pages or shelter referrals.
        Their presence on this list does not constitute an endorsement by either the National House Rabbit Society or
        this Indiana chapter... they are just possible places to start.</p>

    <h3> It is up to you to find the veterinarian who best meets your needs in regards to experience, knowledge,
        personality, location and price.</h3>

    <p> Rather than just relying solely on your veterinarian, it is important to be proactive with your rabbit's health
        care. There are many good sources available to help you learn the latest in disease prevention and treatment
        including books, e-mail discussion lists, magazines, and the internet. Your veterinarian needs you to be a
        partner in your rabbit's health care through feeding a proper diet and accurately recognizing any changes in
        normal behavior.<br> <br>

        If you have knowledge of a good rabbit vet in your area that we do not have listed, please send an e-mail to
        Amanda at <a href="mailto:amanda@indianahrs.org">amanda@indianahrs.org</a> with their complete name, address and
        telephone.</p>
