      Hi Iâ€™m Vanna! I got a very glamorous name because of my fancy hairdo. I'm pretty sassy and I can get in trouble
      when I'm bored! But give me lots of playtime and I am much happier.<br> <br> I get really excited when people come
      by my pen. I really want attention and treats! Sometimes I lunge at hands in my pen, I'd rather come visit you
      outside the pen and not have hands over my head. It took a while until I would trust my people but now I let them
      groom my fur. My long pieces of fur tangle easily, so I will need a little grooming help. <br> <br> I have a big
      personality and I'm looking for a family who will let me show off! I'm probably best for older kids, not little
      ones.
