      Hi, I'm Blini! I'm new here and looking for my forever family. I was born in a camp where my humans didn't have a home to live in so my mom and siblings and I were just roaming free outside. It was scary and I am very happy to be an indoor house bunny now. <br> <br> I am slightly shy with new people and places, but I'm curious and if you give me time, we might just be best friends. I have spent a lot of time with my brothers and sisters and might like a friend someday.
