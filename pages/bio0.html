    <p>
      I'm Akua and I'm new here! I was found running loose for at least a month, it was cold out and hard to find
      food! I'm happy to be a house rabbit now. <br>

      I am a very sweet bunny and very curious. I love my run time! My foster family says I can be shy at first and
      may take a little more time warming up to a person. Once I warm up, I want attention and enjoy being petted!
