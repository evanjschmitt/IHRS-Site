    <p>
      Hi, Iâ€™m Xoliswa! I love being petted!! I run up to the front of my enclosure when my foster family is in my room
      and follow them around soliciting attention. I also love playing with toys, especially those that I can pick up
      and toss and fling :). I have a really sweet personality and enjoy being around people. I get along with older
      people, dogs, and other rabbits, I might want a bunny friend some day. I would rather not be left alone for long
      periods of time, I love being around people so much! <br> <br> I need an adopter or a family who will spend a lot
      of time with me. I have lots of attitude and am a pretty forward bunny; since I am pretty sassy and forward (and
      I'm also a big girl!), I don't do very well with children, I will probably do best in a home with adults who know
      how to speak bunny. An experienced bunny person would be my dream mom or dad!
