      Hi, I'm Sparrow! I am living with my brother right now, Wonka, and we'd love to be adopted together! We are very
      busy and playful because we are still very young. We love when our foster mom comes in, we all periscope to see
      what she brings! We eat a LOT of food because we are still growing. We are both very friendly and curious about
      everything going on around us. We get along with our furry foster siblings (dogs and cats) as well as all the
      humans we've met of all ages and sizes. We would probably be a good fit for even first time bunny family. <br>
      <br> Our dad and mom are both big bunnies, so we will be too! We are similar looking but have just enough
      difference that you can tell us apart. :)",
      bonded: "I'm part of a bonded pair with Wonka!
