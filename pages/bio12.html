      Hi, I'm Isabunna, or Izzy! I was found running loose in a Vincennes neighborhood. I'm happy to be inside now with
      nice people! I'm quiet and have rich, soft fur. I like to lounge like a diva! But you must know.... I do have some
      attitude! I am not fond of new things or people, and sometimes I am a little grumpy about that. But if you are
      patient with me and let me do my thing, eventually I will allow (and maybe enjoy but never admit!) head pets. I
      would love to find a forever home with patient folks that have a slightly more quiet pace of life and know how to
      speak bunny. I love to chew toys and fling baby keys around. My foster mom says I have to have a topper on my pen
      now because I learned how to jump out.
