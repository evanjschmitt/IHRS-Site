    <h4>Bio</h4>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Carlotta! I have severe acquired dental disease which requires periodic tooth trims and
      extractions. I have no molars on the right side of my mouth. I also have a lung abscess and limited lung space for
      air. You can see in the pic the black space is the only place I have to breathe. <br><br> Despite my medical
      conditions I am a super sweet and friendly girl :) I LOVE my pellets, I am super food motivated. I also love to
      binky! It's my second favorite thing! So I need regular run around time with new things to sniff, chin, and
      explore. Iâ€™m a huge cuddle and love to snuggle!
    </p>
