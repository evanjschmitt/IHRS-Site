      Hello Iâ€™m Beatrice! I was found with 55 other buns abandoned outside. While she prefers to approach you, than to be approached, she loves hopping on the couch and asking for pets. Beatrice is really good with her litterbox, and likes to keep her pen tidy. <br> <br> Beatrice loves toys, treats, and adventuring around the house. I am so lucky to be bonded with another female Dahlia that was rescued with me! While Dahlia and I live together, we prefer to have their own litter boxes for now.
