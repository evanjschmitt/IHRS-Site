      Hi, my name is Gizmo and I was born on a playground! I'm glad I made it to rescue right away to grow up safe. My
      foster mama said I have really long legs and I do really good dead bunny flop. I am full of energy and love to do
      binkies and bunny 500. I am also a proud paper shredder and love to tear apart phone books and trash mail. I
      prefer not to be picked up but love to hang out on your belly as long as you pet my head the way I like. <br> <br>
      I was recently returned to rescue and I'm getting used to things again! I will need a family that is pretty bunny
      savvy because I am quite territorial over my space and my enclosure. You will need to speak fluent bunny so you
      can understand my boundaries and how to approach me. I probably would do best in a home with only adults - it can
      be hard for young ones to understand my language and not approach me when I need alone time. If you are an
      experienced bunny savvy person who's up for the challenge of learning how I like things, then maybe we can be best
      friends!
