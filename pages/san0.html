    <h4>Bio</h4>
    <p>
      My name is Armand. I came to Indiana after escaping floods in Louisiana! <br> <br> I'm a very easygoing bunny and
      I enjoy house rabbit life! I love, love, love to be petted. You can pet me all day. I'm also a big fan of my daily
      salad and chowing on lots of hay! <br> <br> During play time I like to do binkies, and during rest time I stretch
      out and enjoy some sun coming in the window. <br> <br> The doctors have been unable to find the source of my GI
      troubles, I have had a LOT of tests! My foster mom does not mind the extra work and mess ;)
