      Hi, I'm Meringue and I'm new here! I'm looking for my forever family. I was born in a camp where my humans didn't
      have a home to live in so my mom and siblings and I were just roaming free outside. It was scary and I am very
      happy to be an indoor house bunny now. I am slightly shy with new people and places, but I'm curious and if you
      give me time, we might just be best friends. I have spent a lot of time with my brothers and sisters and might
      like a bunny friend someday.
    </p>
