      Hi, I'm Maxine, and someone dumped me outside in the cold along a recreational trail in Indy! Thankfully nice
      people worked for several days to capture me. I was covered in hundreds of ticks! I was so happy to get inside
      with good food and nice folks. Now I'm all fixed up and I am a super fun bunny! I love attention, playing, and
      escaping to explore the whole house. I get along pretty well with the other foster buns here too. Who wants to
      meet me and take me home?!
