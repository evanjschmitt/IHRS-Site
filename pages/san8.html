    <h4>Bio</h4>
    <p>
      I am Maybelline. I love having space to kick up my heels in my foster home. Being confined makes me very anxious.
      I have a fear that no one will respect my space like my foster mom does. <br> <br> I prefer to not be in a home
      with children, they make me nervous. I need a forever home with someone with prior rabbit experience, especially
      with rabbits who are slow to trust.
