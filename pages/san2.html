    <p>
      I'm Calamity Jane and I have a little attitude! I was pulled from a shelter and the vet discovered I had a couple
      of teeth that need some attention, they were sticking out through the bottom of my jaw! The nice rescue people got
      me set up with a bunny dentist so I can eat better. But then I just had more problems! My bad teeth were removed,
      and then I had a large abdominal mass removed, and THEN I had a kidney removed that was causing me a lot of
      problems! Wow! <br><br> I am a sassy girl but feeling much better now. I will need more dental surgeries, so I
      have a special foster home where they both appreciate my snark and can also provide me ongoing veterinary
      checkups. Hopefully my worst medical woes are behind me, but I will need continued monitoring of my teeth and my
      bloodwork to make sure my remaining kidney keeps up! It's working well now.
