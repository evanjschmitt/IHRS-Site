      Hi I’m Isla! I was a shy girl when I was found outside but I’ve learned to love being a spoiled house bun. I’m a tiny gal and probably not the best match for young children. I am extremely interactive with my people and LOVE to cuddle. You can pet me as long as you want. If you stop petting me maybe I’ll give you a little nip to let you know you’re not done. I can be spunky like that. I would love to meet you and find my forever family!
