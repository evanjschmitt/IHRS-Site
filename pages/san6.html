      Hi, my name is Kerplunk! I'm bonded to Kirby and we are a delightful pair with a lot of attitude. I'm the more shy
      between us, but that doesn't mean I'm afraid... I just like to do my own thing sometimes. If you have patience
      with me, you will be greatly rewarded by my big personality. My foster family loves watching Kirby and me; we make
      them laugh when we steal lettuce from each other! But we like to snuggle with each other as well. Kirby likes
      being pet a bit more than I do... but I do like to come up and see what my humans are up to! <br> <br> Kirby and I
      are fairly tidy outside of our litter box area, but we can make a mess there now and then. We like a big box! And
      I do tend to shed my fur quite a bit, so some grooming will definitely be required.
    </p>
