        <h2>General Rabbit Questions</h2>
        <h3>
            What's a rabbit really like?
        </h3>
        <p>Many people are surprised to find that rabbits rarely conform to the cute-n-cuddly stereotype in children's
            stories. Baby bunnies (and many young adult rabbits) are too busy dashing madly about, squeezing behind
            furniture, and chewing baseboards and rugs to be held. Domestic rabbits have unique personalities that make
            them wonderful indoor companions. In addition, rabbits are social animals, meaning they need the
            companionship of humans or other animals, although the need may vary among individual rabbbits. Rabbits do
            play, some more than others. Many can get along with most cats and some dogs when properly introduced.
            Rabbits can also be trained to voice commands. They are generally not well suited for living outdoors.
            Rabbits require as much care as any other pet, including medical treatment. With proper care and diet, a
            typical house rabbit's life span is 8 - 12 years.

        </p>
        <h3>How is a rabbit different from a cat or dog?
        </h3>
        <p>Cats and dogs are both predators, while rabbits are prey animals. Because of this fundamental difference,
            there are a few important points to keep in mind. First, rabbits mask illness, making it difficult to
            detect. Consequently, their caretakers must pay close attention to their normal behavior and act on even
            subtle changes. Cats and dogs tend to investigate unknown noises, while rabbits tend to prefer places that
            are generally quieter and will freeze or run away from unknown noises. As prey animals, rabbits generally do
            not enjoy being held, as their instincts tell them they have been "captured". And finally, rabbits survive
            by knowing their environment very, very well. It is very stressful for them when their environment is
            changed, which can lead to illness.

        </p>
        <h3>
            What rabbit is right for me?

        </h3>
        <p>Many people want to start with a young rabbit, but adults (1 year or older) are often easier to start with.
            Rabbits under a year are still "growing up" - full of rambunctious energy, learning about their world
            through more frequent chewing/digging, and dealing with the hormones of rabbit adolescence. Adult rabbits
            are easier to litter train, learn appropriate behavior faster and are still very playful and enjoyable. <br>
            <br>

            Another consideration is the size of a rabbit. While breed itself is not necessarily a factor, smaller
            rabbits tend to be more active and sometimes even skittish. Meanwhile, many larger rabbits tend to be more
            easy-going and are often easier to handle, despite their size. Larger rabbits are recommended for homes with
            children because of these tendencies and because it is less likely the child will attempt to pick up the
            rabbit, possibly hurting either the rabbit or themselves.

        <h2>Litter Questions</h2>
        <h3>Is it true that rabbits can be litterbox trained?
        </h3>
        <p>By nature, rabbits choose one or a few places (usually corners) to deposit their urine and most of their
            pills. Urine training involves little more than putting a litterbox where the rabbit chooses to go. Pill
            training requires only that you give them a place they know will not be invaded by others.

        </p>
        <h3>What factors impact successful litterbox training?
        </h3>
        <p>The most important factor for success is having your rabbit spayed/neutered. This will reduce or eliminate
            his hormonal urge to mark his territory. Also, older rabbits are easier to train than younger rabbits. Young
            rabbits do not have the control and ability to learn that develops from age. If you have a rabbit less than
            6 months old, be patient and persistent. Older rabbits will usually learn in a matter of a few weeks.

        </p>
        <h3>How do I litterbox train my new rabbit?
        </h3>
        <p>The basic approach is pretty simple. Begin by restricting your rabbit to a small space, like his cage, for
            the first week or so. Be sure to have at least one litterbox in a back corner of this space. During the
            week, your rabbit will choose a corner for his "bathroom" area. If this isn't where you originally placed
            the litterbox, simply relocate the box to your rabbit's selected area. In a few days, your rabbit will
            associate the litterbox with his bathroom. At this point, gradually provide more run space. Be sure to
            supervise him carefully during this time, so any accidents can be corrected immediately by putting your
            rabbit back in his litterbox.
            <br> <br> Start will small amounts of space and time and gradually increase both as your rabbit proves his
            good habits. Reinforce consistently any accidents. If your rabbit will have access to more than one room of
            the house, it is a good idea to add more litterboxes as his space continues to grow. Eventually, your rabbit
            will demonstrate how many litterboxes are needed for the size of space he has.
        </p>

    <div class="section" id="cage">
        <h2>Cage Questions</h2>
        <h3>What kind of cages work best?
        </h3>
        <p>Rabbits were not designed to live on wire floors - they're hard on their feet (which have no pads on them,
            like cats or dogs). If you must use a cage with a wire floor, you need to provide your rabbit with a resting
            board or rug for her to sit on; otherwise she will spend all of her time in her litterbox. <br> <br>

            You can find cages with slatted plastic floors, which are more comfortable, or you can use a solid floor. If
            your rabbit has a litterbox in his chosen "bathroom" corner, there shouldn't be much of a mess to clean up.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What size cage is best?
        </h3>
        <p>Bigger is better! A cage should be at least 4 times the size of your rabbit - more if he is confined for a
            large amount of the day. Be sure the cage is large enough to allow space for a litterbox, food and water
            bowls, etc., and still allow your rabbit enough room to stretch out completely. It should also be tall
            enough that your rabbit can stretch up without their ears hitting the top. If the cage has a wire floor, be
            sure to provide something solid, like a towel, newspaper, or board, for your rabbit to lie on.

        </p>
        <h3>What can I do to make my rabbit's cage time more enjoyable?
        </h3>
        <p>A cage should be seen as your rabbit's nest -- a special place where he can feel safe and secure. Make the
            nest enjoyable and he will enjoy being there, even when the cage door is open! Keep it stocked with toys, a
            synthetic sheepskin rug, a piece of wood attached to the inside (like a baseboard), and when you put him to
            bed at night, a nice veggie or fruit snack.

        </p>
        <h3>Can my new rabbit run around my house 24 hours a day?
        </h3>
        <p>An untrained rabbit probably should be kept in a cage while you're not at home to supervise and at night when
            you sleep. Rabbits are crepuscular, which means they generally sleep during the day and during the night but
            are ready to play at dawn and at twilight. Be sure to let him out during the evening when you are at home,
            and if possible, in the morning while you get ready for work. <br> <br>

            When your rabbit is better trained, and when your house has been sufficiently bunny-proofed, your rabbit can
            be allowed free run even when you are not home. The more room your rabbit has to run around in, the more
            delightful you will find her as a companion.</p>
        <h3>What do I need to do to bunny-proof an area?
        </h3>
        <p>Because rabbits are very curious and often chew on things, their exercise area needs to be "bunny-proofed" by
            moving or concealing anything you don't want chewed, especially electrical cords. Common steps taken include
            moving house plants out of reach, covering electrical cords with tubing, applying anti-chewing substances to
            woodwork and furniture, and blocking access to spaces under and around furniture, etc. After you think you
            are done, let your rabbit help you identify areas you have missed. Supervise closely until truly
            bunny-proofed. <br> <br>

            Finally, never attempt to use training alone to keep a rabbit from something that can cause harm or death.
            Toxic houseplants and electrical wires should be impossible for a rabbit to reach. Counting on training or
            "the way she's always behaved" is asking for trouble.</p>

        <h2>Diet and Exercise Questions</h2>
        <h3>
            What can I do to make my rabbit's exercise time more enjoyable?
        </h3>
        <p>First, remember that your rabbit depends on you for companionship. It is important to spend time with him,
            ideally on the floor where he can hop up to you when he chooses. <br> <br>

            Even when a rabbit has a lot of room to run around, he may still get bored. A bored rabbit is often a
            naughty rabbit. If you don't make every attempt to provide your rabbit with lots of entertainment, then he
            will make his own entertainment in your carpet, behind your couch, or under your recliner. <br> <br>

            Toys not only aid in keeping your rabbit out of trouble, they also provide mental stimulation and exercise.
        </p>
        <h3>Can I let my rabbit run loose outside?
        </h3>
        <p>Because domestic rabbits have limited defenses for the many dangers found outdoors, it is best for your
            rabbit to be kept indoors. However, a limited amount of time outside is usually safe if you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Always supervise your rabbit closely when she's outside
            </li>
            <li>Make sure the grass has not been sprayed with pesticides or fertilizers
            </li>
            <li>Check the yard for holes in the fence and poisonous plants
            </li>
            <li>Only allow your rabbit outside during the daylight hours</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What are the basics of a good house rabbit diet?
        </h3>
        <p>A rabbit's diet should be made up of fresh grass hay (timothy, orchard, brome, or oat), fresh vegetables,
            water and good quality pellets. Anything beyond that is a "treat" and should be given in limited quantities
            (approx 1 tablespoon per day total).

        </p>
        <h3>Is feeding hay important?
        </h3>
        <p>Grass hay should be the foundation of your rabbit's diet as it is essential to a rabbit's good health,
            providing roughage, which reduces the danger of hairballs and other blockages. Hay should be available at
            all times. Most rabbits can eat a pile the size of themselves almost every day.

        </p>
        <h3>What kinds of veggies should I feed my rabbit?
        </h3>
        <p>Rabbits enjoy many fresh greens and vegetables and can have up to 2 cups per 5 lbs of body weight daily. Most
            produce is safe to feed your rabbit. They are likely to particularly enjoy: Romaine lettuce, most herbs,
            broccoli, carrots (and tops), spinach, kale, collard greens and many others. Try to serve at least 3
            different kinds of veggies each day, introducing one new food at a time. This will help you determine if any
            particular food is not well tolerated by your rabbit. AVOID: Rhubarb leaves, peas, potatoes, beans, corn,
            onions and garlic.

        </p>
        <h3>What makes a good pellet?
        </h3>
        <p>Pellets should make up a small portion of your rabbit's diet. Unless your rabbit is under 6 months old, he
            should get a set amount of pellets daily and not have constant access to pellets. Pellets should be high in
            fiber (>18%), and low in protein (<14%), calcium (<0.9%) and fat (<2%). Avoid pellet mixes that contain
                seeds, grains, dried corn, or other colorful additives, as these items can be difficult for your rabbit
                to digest and have little nutritional value. It is advisable not to purchase more than 6 weeks of feed
                at a time, as nutritional value degrades over time. </p>

                <h3>What quantities of food should I feed young adults? (6 months to 1 year)
                </h3>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Introduce timothy hay, grass hay, and oat hays, decrease alfalfa

                    </li>
                    <li>Decrease pellets to 1/2 cup per 6 lbs. body weight

                    </li>
                    <li>Introduce daily vegetables and gradually increase quantity

                    </li>
                    <li>Fruit daily ration no more than 1 tablespoon per 6 lbs. body weight (because of calories)
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>What quantities of food should I feed mature adults? (over 1 year)
        </h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unlimited timothy, grass hay, or oat hay
            </li>
            <li>1/4 to 1/2 cup pellets per 6 lbs. body weight (depending on metabolism and/or proportionate to veggies)
            </li>
            <li>Minimum 2 cups chopped vegetables per 6 lbs. body weight
            </li>
            <li>Fruit daily ration no more than 1 tablespoon per 6 lbs. body weight
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>What treats are best for my rabbit?
        </h3>
        <p>Most rabbits consider anything hand-fed a treat, especially fresh veggies. It is not necessary to feed a lot
            of sweet treats or commercial "treats". Rabbits should have no more than 1 tablespoon per day of any of the
            following:
        <ul>
            <li>Fruits: banana, strawberry, blueberry, grapes, papaya, pineapple, apple
            </li>
            <li>Other: whole oats, whole peanuts, alfalfa cube
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Rabbit Health Questions</h2>
        <h3>Why spay and neuter rabbits?
        </h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Altered rabbits are healthier and live longer than unaltered rabbits</li>
            <li>Altered rabbits make better companion animals</li>
            <li>Altered rabbits display fewer obnoxious behaviors that humans find annoying or distasteful</li>
            <li> Altered rabbits can safely have a friend to play with</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>
            Is surgery safe on rabbits?
        </h3>
        <p>Surgery can be as safe on rabbits as on any animal. Unfortunately, the vast majority of veterinarians aren't
            experienced with safe rabbit surgery techniques. Don't allow a veterinarian with little or no rabbit
            experience to spay or neuter your rabbit. Using isofluorene as the anesthetic and appropriate surgical and
            after-surgery techniques, spaying and neutering of rabbits is as safe as for any other animal.

        </p>
        <h3>At what age should rabbits be spayed or neutered?
        </h3>
        <p>Females can be spayed as soon as they sexually mature, usually around 4 months of age, but many veterinarians
            prefer to wait until they are at least 6 months old, as surgery is riskier on a younger female rabbit. Males
            can be neutered as soon as the testicles descend, usually around 3 1/2 months, but many veterinarians prefer
            to wait until they are 5 months old.

        </p>
        <h3>What does the surgery cost?
        </h3>
        <p>Most veterinarians charge between $60 and $180. Neutering a male is generally less expensive than spaying a
            female due to the amount of surgery required.

        </p>
        <h3>What post-operative care should I expect to give my rabbit?
        </h3>
        <p>After surgery, keep the environment quiet so the rabbit doesn't startle or panic. Don't do anything to
            encourage acrobatics, but let the rabbit move around at her own pace - she knows what hurts and what
            doesn't. Do not worry, though! Most veterinarians keep rabbits overnight.</p>
        <h3>What other health issues should I be concerned about?
        </h3>
        <p>No vaccinations are required. However, rabbits' teeth grow continuously and need to be checked at least
            annually by a vet. <br> <br>

            Rabbits have sensitive digestive systems. They best way to maintain it is through a proper diet. As grazing
            animals, rabbits need to have hay constantly to keep their system moving.<br> <br>

            Finally, if you notice any marked change in his behavior, including lethargy, lack of appetite, severe
            diarrhea, sneezing, or nasal discharge, take your rabbit to a veterinarian.</p>
            <h3>What grooming do rabbits require?
            </h3>
            <p>Rabbits shed 4 times per year. Because they ingest fur during their self-grooming process and build up of fur in the digestive system can cause serious problems, it is important to brush them regularly to help remove excess fur and prevent mats. In addition, rabbits' nails grow continuously and need to be trimmed about once a month.

            </p>
            <h3>How should I handle my rabbit?
            </h3>
            <p>While rabbits need to learn to be picked up and handled for necessary exams and grooming, in general they will be happier left to hop about on their own. However, it is still important that you are able to and feel comfortable handling your rabbit. Begin by approaching him slowly and calmly. Grab him firmly on his shoulders (no ears!) and lift. As soon as possible, place a supporting hand under his rump. Some people simply put one hand under the rabbit's tummy and the other on his rump. Bring the rabbit in close to your body and retain a firm grip. Rabbits will kick and struggle if they are not held securely (in their opinion). They also tend to kick more when they are nearing the ground or about to be put into their cage. If you start to lose your hold on the rabbit, drop as close to the ground as possible, so the rabbit does not fall far. To help calm a struggling rabbit, cover his eyes.
