      Hi, I'm Petey! I'm bonded to my brother Razzle and we need to be adopted together. I'm still growing emotionally,
      but pretty well full grown size wise! <br> <br> We love being together and sometimes launch WWIII in our pen as we
      chase each other and then freeze! We love to be petted, my brother somewhat more than I do. When given run time,
      we are both brave explorers who will occasionally surprise each other resulting in jumps and runs! <br> <br> We
      are still learning our litterbox :)
    </p>
