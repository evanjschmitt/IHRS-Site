      Hi I’m Nash, I came to IHRS with some dental issues and I was a VERY grumpy guy. My foster mom called me Nash
      Smash because I was cranky like the Hulk. My teeth are all fixed up now and I’ve much happier…. Still a little
      moody so I do need someone that speaks bunny and will be patient with me and take me to the vet regularly to make
      sure my teeth stay healthy. I’m a little high maintenance but I’m super cute so I get away with it. I love to run
      and explore and play in my tunnel. I’m a big foodie and get super excited during dinner time. I’ll grab my toys
      and run around in circles with them! I especially love my teddy bear. I’m great with my litter box and keep my
      space tidy. When I know I can trust you, I’ll hop all over you. I like head pets but I don’t like you anywhere
      near my tail. Stay out of my danger zone and we can stay friends. I’m a good free roam candidate, and a really
      good helper. I follow you around incase you drop any treats and I’ll clean them right up! I’m excited to find my
      forever family so come meet me!
