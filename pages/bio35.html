      Hi! I’m W’Kabi, pronounced just as it looks! I was born to Ramonda in foster care. We’re all named after
      characters from the movie Black Panther. This all started because they said my mom looks like a Queen rabbit. <br>
      <br> I like to explore and get on the furniture. I also love cuddles and pets! I'm a very big boy so I'd rather
      climb on you or sit next to you than be picked up. I did well with kids. I prefer to have a lot of exploration
      space to live, instead of being cooped up. I might be grumpy if you reach over my head in a pen, but when I'm out
      and about I'd love to hang out! <br> <br> Do you need a very big bunny with one flopped ear in your life??
