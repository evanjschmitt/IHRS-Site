      Hello I’m Dahlia! I was one of many bunnies that were abandoned outside. I’m a bit timid but I enjoy laying on my
      foster and getting pets. I am still working on trusting humans, but I have really come out of my shell now that
      I’m bonded with my friend Beatrice. I really like finding a quiet spot, and watching Beatrice while she plays.
      While Beatrice and I live together, we prefer to have their own litter boxes for now.
