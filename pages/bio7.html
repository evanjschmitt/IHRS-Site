      Coco and four other rabbits were found wondering around a neighborhood in Merrillville, IN. Since is grateful to
      be a house rabbit and settled in quickly. <br> <br> Coco is a very curious, social with both people and other
      rabbits, and loves to be petted. Her play area is full of toys and Coco bunstructed a custom made playhouse from a
      cardboard box. She is a very busy girl! <br><br> Coco would do well in a home where she has alot of space to run
      around and explore as she is full of energy. <br> <br> Do you have space in your heart to give this cutie a
      forever home?
