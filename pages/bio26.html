      Hi I’m Pinto! I was found outside on a super rainy day. I was so tired of being stuck outside & ready to be a
      house rabbit that I just let one of the rescuers walk up to me & pick me up. I know no stranger but my favorite
      people are the ones with a treat for me. I like to run and binky and play in the long curtains. I am a good free
      roam candidate. I’m still young and have a lot of energy so I will need lots of play time. I would love to meet
      you!
