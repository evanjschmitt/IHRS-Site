        <p>I'm Akua and I'm new here! I was found running loose for at least a month, it was cold out and hard to find
          food! I'm happy to be a house rabbit now.</p>

        <p>I am a very sweet bunny and very curious. I love my run time! My foster family says I can be shy at first
          and may take a little more time warming up to a person. Once I warm up, I want attention and enjoy being
          petted!</p>
