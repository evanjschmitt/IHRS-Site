      Hi I'm Rosevie! I was found outside as a baby and I really like being a house rabbit. I have great litter box
      habits and love my free roam time. I am a little shy at first but can be persuaded with treats. I prefer to
      interact with you when you are on my level. My foster family has spent a lot of time helping me to trust & be a
      confident girl. They will make fun obstacle courses for me to run through, jump on, & hide under. I love it
      because I am adventurous and love to explore. I find foraging for food super fun. I love to zoom around as fast as
      I can and I will binky myself silly. After I have wore myself out I like laying around relaxing. I’m a fun girl
      with a big personality & I can’t wait to meet you!
