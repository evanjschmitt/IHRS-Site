      Hi there! My name is Amara because I was rescued during the week of Valentine’s Day. I was found in a backyard on Grissom all on my own, living under a deck. When I was first rescued, I didn’t trust these giants too much and hid from them. But after about a day, I decided they weren’t going to hurt me and began to trust them a bit more. Now I love my indoor house bunny life! <br> <br> I like to explore everywhere, so bunny proofing needs to be a priority with me! I’m a mini-Rex so I’m super soft, and I absolutely love pets. I’ll even come to you and ask for them!
