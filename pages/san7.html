      Hi, my name is Kirby and I'm a delightful bunny with a big attitude! I am bonded to Kerplunk and I'm the more
      outgoing of the pair. Sometimes I like to steal greens from Kerplunk, but don't worry, she can hold her own and
      steal them back! Our foster family loves watching us interact with each other, and laughing at our antics!
      Kerplunk isn't as interested in being petted, but I like pets for a limited amount of time. I can also do some
      champion flops if you watch me long enough. Work hard, play hard! <br> <br> I can make myself fairly tall when I
      periscope so some bunny proofing will be needed. If there is a way to escape my area, I will find it! Kerplunk and
      I are fairly tidy though, outside of our litter box area. We like to kick the hay out sometimes and just eat it
      next to the box... we definitely like an extra large box!
    </p>
