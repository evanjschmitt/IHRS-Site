      Hi, my name is Lofte! I was abandoned in a filthy cage on the side of the road, I was starving and had lost all of
      the fur on my underside. My foster family is the BEST!! My foster mom says that I am a Cookie Monster :) My fur
      has completely grown back and i have gained weight. <br><br>I am super curious about what you are doing in my
      space. I do not like it when you move my toys around and will be literally on top of you when you are in my
      space!! I love to dig and chew, so foster mom says I will need lots of enrichment and supervision. <br><br> I will
      need an adopter who will spend a TON of time with me, work to help me feel secure, continue to help me gain
      weight, and respect my space.
