      Hi, I'm Fitz! I was born in rescue and my parents and siblings have all been adopted. But I get to stay with the
      rescue people because I'm a little differently abled! I'm a very special bunny who has a couple legs that don't
      work right and I get pretty dizzy and fall over a lot. I even had to have one of my eyes removed because I lay on
      my side so much it kept getting infected and very painful. But I'm all healed from that, and super happy with my
      bumpers to lean on, lots of great food, and my salads almost always have my favorite: fennel! <br> <br>I'm just
      hanging out doing my Fitzy thing. My foster people have to do a lot of care for me since I can't hop or use the
      litterbox, but I keep myself quite clean and I'm in charge of my day! My medical expenses have been more than most
      bunnies and I need food, hay, greens for the rest of my life, so donations to the rescue are always appreciated to
      help with my care.
