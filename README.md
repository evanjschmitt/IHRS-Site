# IHRS-Site
This is my N-215 honors project for the Indiana House Rabbit Society. 

During this project, I learned more jQuery functions, along with a brief touch into more advnaced subjects. The "adoptables" and "sanctuary" pages all have content that is dynamically injected from an array. I was attemting to make a "pop-up" page for the rabbit bio pages, but I ran into various issues and ended up scrapping the idea for now. I plan to build on this over the summer, in order to keep my coding skills sharp.
